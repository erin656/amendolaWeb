<h1> Amendola Plaza Redesign </h1>
<p>
"Amendola Plaza in the Pelham Bay neighborhood of Bronx Community Board 10 is a terrible place. The surrounding community doesn't really care as long as traffic and homeless people keep moving. By supporting increased commercial and community activity and by making physical improvements to the Plaza and surrounding streetscapes, the community may be able to redeem themselves."
